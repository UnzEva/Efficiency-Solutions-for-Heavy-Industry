<b>Efficiency-Solutions-for-Heavy-Industry</b>

Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for a company that develops effective solutions for heavy industry.
The model should predict the amount of gold extracted from the gold ore. You have data on extraction and purification.
The model will help to optimize production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.
Project stages:
1. Data preparation;
2. Perform data analysis;
3. Develop and train a model.
The project uses documentation from pandas, matplotlib and sklearn.
